TO DO:

- Deep nested groups not fully persisting (only first level?)
  Found when solving bottom-right corner

- Solved groups become movable when merging another group on to them - hard to replicate.

- 1px gaps still occurring when zoomed out -> account for zoom level when snapping ?

- Watch out for backend errors on save
